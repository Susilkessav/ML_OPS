      "Product Description",
      "DuraBlend\u2122 has a unique blend of premium synthetic and conventional base oils with advanced additive technology designed for tough driving conditions.",
      "Amazon.com",
      "Motor oil is made from crude oil and is used to lubricate, clean, and cool engines. Types of motor oil include conventional, synthetic, diesel, bio-based, hybrid (blends of conventional and synthetic), and recycled oils. Motor oil varies in weight and viscosity, as well as additives that some manufacturers add to the oil during the refining process. A numerical code system created by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) grades motor oils according to viscosity--the higher the number between 0 and 60, the more viscous (thicker) the oil is. Most consumer motor oils are graded by two numbers, with the first number indicating cold weather (Winter or \"W\") performance.",
      "SAE 10W-40",
      "This oil has a weight of SAE 10W-40, meaning it has an SAE viscosity rating of 10 in cold temperatures and a rating of 40 at normal operating temperature. Always check your vehicle's owner's manual to verify that this is the correct weight of motor oil for your vehicle.",
      "Semi-Synthetic Oil",
      "This oil is a semi-synthetic oil, meaning only some crude oil is used in making it. Semi-synthetic oil can be used in vehicle engines instead of motor oils refined from crude oil, and often provides superior mechanical performance over traditional motor oil, including increased gas mileage and reduced engine wear at extreme temperatures. Its complex method of production means it can often cost more than conventional motor oil.",
      "Please note that you should not mix quarts of synthetic and conventional motor oils in your vehicle, and if you use semi-synthetic or full synthetic oil in your vehicle, you should not change the oil with conventional motor oil.",
      "From the Manufacturer",
      "Valvoline's DuraBlend Synthetic Blend Motor Oil - Meets the Demands of Today's Tough Driving Conditions",
      "Whether you are driving a high-output engine, making frequent trips or simply looking for advanced protection in extreme temperatures, you will get the performance you need from Durablend synthetic blend motor oil. Durablend offers a premium blend of synthetic and conventional base oils, plus advanced additive technology provides added protection against severe driving. As a synthetic blend oil, Durablend gives you heavy duty protection against tough driving conditions from stop-and-go traffic to long engine running time. It\u2019s advanced protection in moments when conventional oils have a tendency to begin to break down.   Synthetic blend motor oils work harder and longer than convention oils to provide enhanced engine protection. And, in cooler temperatures, synthetic blend oils hold their viscosity, which gives your engine protection even at start up. Conventional oils and synthetic blends are fully compatible, so you can make the switch to the advanced protection of Durablend without risk to your vehicle.",
      "Frequently Asked Questions About Valvoline's DuraBlend",
      "Valvoline's Engine Guarantee Programcan cover your engine if it fails",
      "Is it ok to use DuraBlend in a motorcycle or ATV?",
      "No. DuraBlend is not wet-clutch safe and can cause slipping problems if used.",
      "What is the recommended oil change interval for DuraBlend?",
      "Just like crude oil refining, re-refining of used oil creates base oils of different quality levels. And we select only those recycled base oils that meet our exacting quality standards. At this time, there is only enough of the highest-quality recycled base oils to make a 50% blend. We are continually working with oil re-refiners to generate more of the top-quality base oil, and we certainly hope to move the percentage of recycled base oils higher in the future.",
      "What is the recommended oil change interval for DuraBlend?",
      "Valvoline recommends following the oil change intervals recommended in your owner's manual no matter what type of oil you use. Most manufacturers recommend every 3-months/3,000 miles.",
      "If I switch to DuraBlend can I ever go back to using a conventional motor oil?",
      "Yes. Conventional and synthetic oils are 100% compatible.",
      "Is DuraBlend covered by the Valvoline Engine Guarantee program?",
      "Yes. The Valvoline Engine Guarantee covers your engine if it fails, hassle free. If you have 125,000 miles or less, using Valvoline's DuraBlend can give you an engine guarantee up to 225,000 miles. Registration required, visit",

      "Legend has it Evil Road Spirits have been latching themselves on to motorcycles for as long as there have been bikes on the road. These Evil Road Spirits are responsible for mechanical problems and bad luck along a journey. Legend goes on to say that by attaching a small bell onto your bike, the Evil Road Spirits will become trapped inside the bell where the constant ringing drives them insane, making them lose their grip until they fall to the ground. (Ever wonder where pot-holes come from?) It is also believed that the mystery of the Guardian Bell carries twice as much power when it is purchased by a friend or loved one and given as a gift. Show someone how much you care. Offer them defense against the Evil Road Spirits! Give a Guardian Bell and share the Legend of Good Luck it offers to a motorcycle and its rider! All Guardian Bells are made of Lead Free Pewter in the USA"

Coated with black zinc finish Ultimax sport rotors are complete with bearing cups where fitted as OEM and are sold and priced in sets for either front or rear. The price you see is for two rotors, one left one right. Another great feature of slotted rotors is the way they maintain flat and parallel pad wear and avoid the record grooves or galling common with non-slotted rotors. This improves pad contact and braking throughout the life of the rotor and pad set."

Dash Covers offer 100% protection against UV Ray damage, which damage will cause your vehicle's dashboard to fade in color, and crack or warp over time. These are also great for revitalizing older worn dashes that show signs of wear and age. Available in 9 different colors to get a close color match, keeping the interior looking professional and clean. We use the latest software and computer programmed cutting machines to manufacture the best fitting dash covers for your exact Vehicle. Our dash covers take in effect all air vents, sensors, airbags, dash trays and cup holders, and all other necessary functions on the dash (dash speakers get covered as that is generally the first part of the dash that cracks due to heat, speaker sound penetrates through the dash as though it wasn't there). We include self-adhesive Velcro for easy installation."

      "CURT class 3 trailer hitches are designed, built and tested to accommodate a wide variety of towing applications. They are used on everything from full-size cars, vans and crossovers to light-duty pickup trucks and SUVs. Class 3 trailer hitches are perfect for towing fishing boat trailers, popup campers, ATV trailers, utility trailers and much more. They are also ideal for adding storage space to your vehicle with a hitch-mounted cargo carrier or bike rack (NOTE: Never exceed the lowest-rated towing component). Each CURT class 3 hitch is engineered to fit on a specific vehicle. If you own a vehicle with a trailer hitch, you know how quickly the receiver tube can get built up with dirt, debris and road grime. It does not take long before inserting a ball mount or hitch-mounted accessory into your trailer hitch becomes more difficult than it should ever have to be. With enough time and moisture exposure, the inside of a receiver tube can become seized up with rust, making it very difficult to use. Keep your trailer hitch's receiver tube clean and protected when not towing with one of CURT's attractive and durable tube covers. This CURT 2\" x 2\" receiver tube cover is constructed from quality rubber and mounts on your trailer hitch with a friction fit, meaning no hitch pin or clip is required."

      "Connections: The terminal marked \"+\" is for positive volts. The terminal marked \"-\" is for ground. These must be hooked up for the indicator to record battery usage. With only these two terminals hooked up, there will be no display showing. This is done to conserve battery power, but the meter is monitoring the batteries When you want to see the display, connect the terminal marked \"C\" to a positive volt source (+ and - terminals should still be connected). \"C\" can be hard wired to have the display showing all of the time or can be used through a momentary contact switch to see the battery status by depressing the momentary contact switch. Another method for installation would be to connect \"C\" to a terminal coming from a switch key that goes hot when the key is turned on. Remember that + and - must always be connected."

You can also create custom bookmarks and find that information you need over and over again, quickly and easily. TechSpark Studio programs also includes an integrated zoom and pan tool to easily focus on every detail clearly as possible. One of the best features is the ability to print specific pages or the entire program and if the pages get dirty and greasy, simply print a fresh copy the next time you need the information. TechSpark Studio programs don't just include all of the model specific information for your vehicle you have, but also extensive basic service and maintenance information that can help with any general service and repair you need to accomplish. Plus gain quick access to the full online parts catalog and complete wiring diagrams for your vehicle. TechSpark Studio programs works on Windows and MAC computers. (Minimum Requirements: Windows XP / MAC OSX 10.4) You will have full access to all the information, without needing to have online access, as the program runs directly on your computer."

It can be used for all gearboxes and gearbox/differential without limited slip system operating under moderate loads and revolution speeds or transfer gearboxes, mechanical transmissions without hypoid gear, reduction gears operating under moderate to severe load and revolution speed. The lubricant forms an efficient anti wear protection, reinforced with synthetic base stocks for a better resistance at high temperature and improved life time. It has very high lubricating power which decreases friction and wear. The fluid at low temperature allows easier gear shifting when the gearbox is cold thus less effort is required on the gear lever to shift the gears. It is suitable for any type of seal and yellow material used in gearboxes design and has anti-corrosion and anti-foam properties."

      "1. Paint Strainers are a great solution for removing unwanted dust, particulates, & impurities from latex & oil based paints. Can be used on any paint, new or old, including varnishes, resins, & stains. 2. The paint flows well through the mesh & the mesh size filters out small particles that would have possibly clogged spray guns or made the job hard.Super handy for straining or mixing 'floaters' out of your expensive resin. 3. Regularly strain oil-based paints & glazes through them & it will make your work much easier. 4. Easy-to-use, with less spilling -- saves time, & does a great job.Don\u2019t use metal sieves, use these & toss them out; no messy clean-up! 5. Anytime you put paint into your gun, Strain it first! Don\u2019t Spent hours fighting poor pressure at the tip, & cleaning the little round screen at the bottom of the bottle. 6. Don\u2019t throw away what seems to be \u2018useless\u2019 lumpy paint. Just buy these fine strainers & give them a good sift through & all the lumps & dirt will vanish",
      "Benefits:",
      "- For all types of paints & chemicals - Removes paint clumps & solids - Eliminates impurities in new & old paint alike - Maintains a consistent, even paint thickness - Prevents spray gun clogging - Strong, durable construction - Easy to use on small amounts of paint"

Have you tried to break a CD compact disc before? It can\u2019t be done! CDs are made of polycarbonate. Supercross, Motocross, UTV & ATV safety glasses should be able to withstand flying rocks and debris. Choose from fiery orange, emerald green or bermuda blue mirror lenses.",
      "180 WRAP PROTECTION: In order to block UV rays, wind &debris from all angles, you need wind proof motorcycle sunglasses w/ 180 degree wrap protection. Built for high speeds and harmful working conditions, wrap glasses offer protection that keep your eyes comfortable and safe. Motorcycle goggles are designed to block sun from the front, sides and behind you. Wrap style motorcycle shades are aerodynamic so they wont fly off when turning your head. The faster you ride, the more snug they feel.",
      "NON-SLIP RUBBER NOSE & EAR PIECES : Whether you are riding your Harley, Honda, Yamaha or Suzuki, you need motorcycle riding glasses for men that won\u2019t slide down your nose, or fly off in the wind. If you sweat, ordinary plastic nosepieces can slip. Rubber nose and ear pieces won't slip and more comfortable for those long rides.",
      "MULTI LAYER MIRROR ANTI-GLARE LENSES : We guarantee you will love these mirrrored lenses. Mirror lenses filter out an additional 10 - 25% more light. The lenses are soothing to your eyes and increase sharpness & clarity. You don't actually see blue or red; the lenses are grey with a slight brownish tint. So, if you are sensitive to bright sunlight or glare, you should try these biker glasses. But be careful, you may never want to take them off!"

      "With Replay fabric top replacements for Jeep and small import SUVs, you get just what you need at the prices you want. You get just what you need to replace the fabric and window panels with nothing else to buy. Replay has many features found on more expensive tops, and doesn't skimp on material quality or construction like bargain-basement alternatives.",
      "Fabric",
      "23 ounce dual-layer poly/cotton fabric is UV-resistant to help prevent color fade, plus resistance to stains and mildew, even in humid climates. Using computerized cutting technology, Pavement Ends matches patterns to factory specifications assuring a tight, smooth fit over your factory-original bows. Available in OEM-matching colors.",
      "Easy Installation",
      "Installing or removing a soft top can be a chore, but Replay soft tops make it quick and easy using the vehicle's factory BeltRail channel system on Jeep Wranglers. The top has integrated extrusion strip that simply presses into the channel for a smooth, secure fit around the body tub. No drilling required.",
      "Construction",
      "Replay features 135 gauge factory-spec marine-grade thread in all seams for superior strength. Seams are double-stitched and heat-sealed to stop any moisture penetration.",
      "Doors",
      "Replay soft tops are available to fit with factory full steel doors, or come with door skins that cover factory upper half-door frames. Upper half-door skins have clear, zippered windows.",
      "Windows",
      "Pavement Ends uses only D.O.T. approved 25-mil vinyl windows in Replay soft tops. You have the option of clear windows for more light inside, or 31% tinted windows to help keep the sun's heat (and curious eyes) at bay. All windows are 100% heat-sealed to assure no moisture can penetrate through the window perimeter. And of course, all window panels are removable on Wrangler models.",
      "Zippers",
      "When it comes to removing or installing soft top windows, quality zippers mean everything. That's why Replay soft tops use heavy-duty coil zippers found in factory-original tops. They resist jamming or going off track even after years of use. Rear side windows have handy pull tabs, and the rear window curtain has two metal pull tabs so the window can be rolled up and secured for open air flow.",
      "The Smart Choice When Quality, Features and Price Come Together",
      "Pavement Ends is Bestop\u2019s most affordable line of soft tops and accessories. Bestop has been manufacturing replacement soft tops and Jeep accessories for 60 years, and is the sole supplier of factory-installed soft tops on Jeep Wranglers for more than 25 years. All that engineering and technology expertise makes its way into our Pavement Ends line of products.",
      "Pavement Ends gives Jeep owners a smarter choice when replacing a soft top without sacrificing ease of installation and dependability. The features, fabrics and hardware in Pavement Ends soft tops have different specifications than top-of-the-line Bestop products, but you still get a quality product that represents tremendous value. Pavement Ends offers a variety of replacement soft tops and cool fabric accessories for your Jeep or small import SUVs.",

Stone ejectors within the Ridge Grappler's tread protect the bottom of the groove from stone drilling, and the dual sidewall design that comes standard with the Grappler family allows drivers to choose between two bold looks for their tires."

This kit replaces both door handle rod clips, giving you the peace of mind that when you need to get into your car the handle will work. When one exterior door handle stops working, the other one usually breaks shortly afterwards. Included are 2 new rod clips to replace the parts in both doors. Installing the clips is quick and easy and can be done completely from the inside by removing the inside door panel."

      "Brand New NIPPON MACHINES brand gasket with guaranteed fit and function. All Materials and Manufacturing Sourced and MADE IN USA. Listing picture is of actual Gasket material. The gasket material is treated chemically to seal against oils, water, alcohol, grease, air, gasoline and solvents. Why Reproduction? Original (NOS) gaskets from the 1950's-1980's are mostly plant fiber based which become brittle and hardened over the decades and drastically lose their sealing ability. I've received many NOS that are hard as a rock and will break during shipment or installation. Why Nippon Machines? Gasket material quality. Hard work and pride. These are carefully examined to ensure proper OEM fitment. If you need any assistance, feel free to ask. Need other gaskets? Please message me, I have nearly all gaskets excluding metal and rubber composites for Japanese motorcycles.

There\u2019s a reason why the most well-respected performance suspension brands use Proforged ball joints - we\u2019re fanatical about quality, performance, and durability. Professionals save time and money with our competitively-priced products that outlast inferior brands. Do the job with confidence - replace your worn components with the leader in performance ball joints: Proforged.",
      "WHAT IS A BALL JOINT? A ball joint is an enclosed spherical bearing that connects the control arm to the steering knuckle or spindle - it is a ball-and-socket design, just like your hip, and it needs to be replaced as it wears out. A worn ball joint causes poor handling and makes it difficult or impossible to achieve an alignment, which leads to rapid tire wear. Replacing your worn ball joints gives a noticeable improvement in steering feel, handling, and safety."

      "Laboratory tested and proven in the real world, their ball joints feature improved design over the competition for increased longevity and durability, even in the most demanding conditions. Proforged ball joints are available for nearly every year, make, and model vehicle."

      "Fitments* Compatible with Toyota Tundra 2003-2006Introduction Black stainless steel car grills are the perfect alternative to chrome grill inserts. In a world full of the same chromed out look, the black eGrille is here to save the day. What is the difference between the eGrille and a chrome grill insert? The black eGrille is stainless steel and powder coated for added protection against rusting and wear. Guaranteed to outlast and out perform grilles that are plasti dipped black, the black eGrille is your most durable and stylish choice. Each bar on this grill insert is twice as wide as the competition and have smaller gaps in between, making it beefy and aggressive looking.

Bosch pumps are designed to operate in extreme temperatures and under low fuel conditions to ensure reliable performance and an extended service life.

      "Why Do MAF Sensors Fail?",
      "The Mass Air Flow sensor is located in the intake ducting after the air filter.Contamination is a key reason why MAF sensors fail and require replacement. As air, dirt and other debris get into the sensor, the parts become contaminated and fail. Drivers often notice sluggish performance, rough idling or even stalling. There may also be a more frequent need to refuel.",

      "Install Notes: Depending on your application it may be necessary to hard-wire the resistor / flash controller. Each Resistor has four wires coming out of it; two Positive wires (yellow - one for input and one for output) and two Negative wires (black - one for input and one for output). This allows for a plug-and-play type application when using bullet wire connectors. One Resistor / Flash Controller must be installed in line for each LED light connected to the motorcycle signal circuit. This also includes use with Tail Integrator kits. Mount the resistor and button everything back up, your done. Fitment Information: Universal - When hard-wiring these resistors, the bike Make and Model options are too many to list. These Resistors work with Honda, Kawasaki, Yamaha, Suzuki, Triumph, Ducati, Harley Davidson, Aprilia, and other 12 volt electrical systems. Additionally, these resistors can be used on automobile applications. We also have LED Turn Signal Relays available in our store as an alternative way to control your flash rate when using LEDs on your motorcycle."

      "Rugged Ridge wheel spacers are the solution to clearance issues when fitting wider tires on your Jeep, while also increasing track width for improved stability on and off-road. This set of black hub-centric 1.25-inch wheel spacers from Rugged Ridge has a 5 x110 mm bolt pattern and 65.1 mm bore diameter. The hub-centric construction ensures the wheel is precisely centered on the hub or axle, minimizing stress on wheel studs and eliminating vibrations that are common with non-hub-centric designs. Rugged Ridge spacers are constructed of double-anodized, extra-thick 6061-T6 aluminum for long life and superior corrosion resistance. High-strength Grade 8 studs and lug nuts are included for reliable performance."

      "There is no background color. The surface that you apply the sticker to will become your background color. This will be a single color sticker. This is a DIE-CUT vinyl decal meaning that the background has been trimmed off. If there is a background color in the picture, it is used only as a representation. The background color will be the surface color you place the sticker on (or clear if you put it on a window). The decal will come with clear transfer tape, so you can easily apply it to anything you like (walls, windows, cars, mailbox, mirrors, laptops, etc etc etc). I use PREMIUM Oracal brand vinyl for all decals. Application is relatively easy. Your decal will come as THREE pieces - the backing paper, the sticker itself, and the clear transfer tape. Make sure you are applying to a CLEAN surface. You carefully pull the clear transfer tape up from the backing paper, making sure that it pulls the sticker up with it (if it does not, then firmly press down on it with a squee-gee or credit card or something similar until it sticks properly to the clear transfer tape). Then you apply the sticker and clear transfer tape to whatever surface you would like the decal on. You then use a squee-gee or credit card or something similar to firmly press down once again, making sure that the sticker STICKS, and then you carefully and slowly remove the clear transfer tape from the top, leaving behind only the sticker. I have found that on some surfaces (especially walls and wood surfaces), it helps to leave the clear transfer tape on for awhile to make sure everything is sticking well before removing it. I do not issue refunds or exchanges on vinyl decals. Please understand this before you bid. Some decals are more difficult to apply than others (especially the little ones!) - likewise, some surfaces are more difficult to apply decals to."

      "Is your home being overrun by unpleasant odors? Whether you own a pet, frequently cook or live with a smoker, Protect Plus Industries' The Web Filter Fresh Whole Home Tropical Bay Air Freshener is all you need to keep your entire home smelling great for days. The secret to the Filter Fresh pads' effectiveness lies in an odor counteractant that works with fragrance to combat your home's most unpleasant odors. Coming in an exotic scent of tropical bay, this air freshener perfectly accommodates an apartment, home or office, filling the entire space with a special odor-fighting formula. Have small areas that could use a little refresher? The Filter Fresh air freshener can handle that too, eliminating odors in closets, bathrooms and even your car. And it couldn't be easier to use: Simply attach the Filter Fresh pads to any size filter on a central furnace or AC unit. It will even work on electrostatic filters, but don't use the pads on these types of filters if it is directly connected to your household's electrical currents. Have an oscillating fan? Then you can connect Filter Fresh to the front of it, allowing you to pleasantly scent one room at a time. For days of a tropical paradise to revive your stale office, apartment or closet, use Protect Plus Industries' The Web Filter Fresh Whole Home Tropical Bay Air Freshener.",

Great for parties, open houses, holidays and to help reduce lingering household odors like smoke, kitchen, bathroom and pet odors. Safer than candles and FilterFresh lasts longer than aerosol sprays. Scents last for days depending on the size of your home and how much the system is running."

The helmet is DOT compliant so you can ride with it anywhere a helmet is required. One feature we like about this helmet is the drop down shield. Its there when you need it and gone when you dont.

      "The BAKFlip HD (Heavy Duty) Tonneau Cover / Truck Bed Cover has all of the great good looks and functionality of the BAKFlip G2 (Generation 2) Model but in a Heavy Duty / OEM (Factory) Quality version as this cover's outer surfaces are ALL METAL like the BAKFlip G2! However, the core of the BAKFlip HD Tonneau Cover / Truck Bed Cover is 25% more dense, 1/8\" thicker and is much more rigid then the G2. The BAKFlip HD opens, closes, and operates identically to the BAKFlip G2 Model, however the BAKFlip HD has the following refinements: Panels on HD are 5/8\" thick vs 1/2\" thick for the G2 .The BAKFlip HD's textured flat aluminum surfaces on all panels have two coats of epoxy primer that is baked on at 460 degrees. This entire expoxy primer coating process is completed twice (first coat applied, baked on and cooled, and then the process is repeated). Once the two coats of primer has set, an extraordinarily tough and scratch-resistant polyester based coating is used as the final finishing coat (which gives the look of a tough, baked on enamel, but is much higher quality). This coating process ensures that the covers is both scratch and UV resistant. The 2 stage enamel process makes for a final finishing coat that is more of a factory look. The BAKFlip HD handles approximately 25% more distributed weight when compared to the G2. The HD is much more rigid then the G2. Quality and Rigidity Standards Endorsed by OEM - The BAKFlip HD is an Original Equipment Part for one of the Big 3 Automakers 2 year warranty for the BAKFlip HD vs. 1 year warranty for the BAKFlip G2. Powder coated pivoting arms - (G2 has zinc plated) Integrated tie down points underneath and on top of the cover (\u201cD\u201d Rings placed at strategic points under the cover). Extra Set of Clamps (8 clamps) provided for added rigidity (4 on each side). The G2 uses a total of 6 clamps. The BAKFlip HD has a higher quality finished look when compared to the BAKFlip G2 because of the 2 stage epoxy primer on the HD."

      "FA series organic pads provide fingertip stopping power and are the preferred choice for many sport bike riders, having low disc attack characteristics and medium lifetime. Semi metallic pads are blended with up to 30 or 50 percent cheap steel fiber, organic pads are made with man made fibers such as or Twaron bonded together with a petrochemical resin and sintered metal pads are copper alloy fused together under heat and pressure. Organic pads have attracted many enthusiasts because of the way they work. They are inherently softer easier on rotors and have a brake feel preferred by many riders. the EBC series has now been renamed NAO series or Non-Asbestos Organic. The NAO series are a superb all round value-for-money replacement for all levels of motorcycle and are still extremely popular with many riders who prefer the \"feel\" of organic pads. Most EBC organic pads have expansion grooves which reduce noise and prevent cracking. The aramid fiber compound with non-ferrous particles helps to prevent surface \"scorching\" under load. Measures 36mm length by 39mm width by 6mm height."

EBC brake shoes are made using either high pressure die cast aluminum platforms or steel platforms common on modern ATV drum brakes with bonded brake linings. All shoes are radius ground and edge trimmed and also feature lead in and lead out chamfers at lining ends and original equipment style brake shoe springs. EBC produced two ranges of brake shoes, both of which have always featured non asbestos linings for health safety and environmental reasons. Standard linings are a direct OEM replacement and the EBC WG Series water groove brakes shoes are the perfect answer for off road use where the grooves channel away dirt, dust, water and debris."

An aerodynamic frame keeps your car sleek and streamlined, while the design also allows for quiet, streak-free wiping. The hook attachment is easy to install and compatible with a wide variety of vehicles. An included prepping cloth can be used to further improve the performance of the wipers by coating your windshield with a water-repelling solution.

    "rating_number": 2,
    "features": [
      "Fully adjustable air springs level your vehicle when towing or hauling a heavy load for a safe comfortable ride",
      "Eliminate sag and bottoming out",

      "Product Description",
      "AIR LIFT Ride Control Rear Air Spring Kit is designed to adjust the air spring level of the vehicle while towing. It includes air spring, hardware and durable component. This kit eliminates sag and features 5000 pounds of leveling capacity. It facilitates easy and quick installation.",
      "From the Manufacturer",
      "Air Lift adjustable air helper springs level your load, and give your truck, van, or SUV a safer, more comfortable ride. Air springs are easy to install between your existing springs and the vehicle frame. Just add air when towing or hauling a heavy load, and reduce air pressure when unloaded; they are fully adjustable for a great ride. Air Lift air springs eliminate sag, sway, and bottoming out. They are made with rugged, durable components for long, reliable service.",
      "Air Lift RideControl kits fit many of our most popular customer vehicles with leaf springs, including \u00bd ton and mini pickups, full-size and mini vans, and SUVs.",
      "Application Information",
      "This RideControl kit, number 59517, fits the 1969 to 1995 Toyota extended cab pickup, 4-wheel drive. This kit can be easily installed in around 2 hours.",
      "RideControl",
      "Many of today's most popular light-to-medium duty trucks, vans, and SUVs are built for a more comfortable, car-like ride. That's fine when the vehicle is lightly loaded. But add a trailer, or all the things people haul for work and pleasure, and the vehicle sags and the ride suffers. Fully adjustable, RideControl kits keep your truck, van, or SUV level and riding comfortably with no load, loaded, or towing on any road condition. Air adjustable from 5 to 100 PSI, Air Lift RideControl air helper springs have up to 2,000 pounds of leveling capacity, right up to the manufacturer's recommended Gross Vehicle Weight Rating. Your RideControl kit also includes quick connecting, easy-to-use air fittings. All kits are engineered to be easy to install and come with Air Lift's exclusive alignment tool and a fully illustrated instruction manual.",
      "Why Air?",
      "Factory suspensions must compromise between ride comfort and load hauling capacity. Soft factory suspensions can't carry heavy loads, and heavy steel springs ride rough, especially when the vehicle is unloaded. Only air springs can support your heavy loads and provide a great ride. Air Lift adjustable air springs solve these common problems by allowing you to tune your suspension under all load and road conditions. Just add air when towing or hauling and then remove air for a softer ride when unloaded.",
      "Eliminate these common load and towing problems for good when you use Air Lift air springs:",
      "Sag \u2013 Proper weight distribution to all tires improves steering, braking and tire wear. This is especially important while towing: adjust the air springs to accept the tongue weight of the trailer or other heavy loads.",
      "Headlight aim \u2013 Only level and stable vehicles provide safe and proper headlight aiming \u2013 critical for night driving safety.",
      "Rough ride \u2013 Air Lift's progressive spring rate soaks up bumps, keeping tires on the road for better handling.",
      "Bottoming out \u2013 Air Lift springs restore normal ride height when heavily loaded or towing, reducing suspension wear and eliminating crashing on bumps.",
      "Sway and body roll \u2013 Air springs increase spring rate and vastly improve vehicle stability. When towing trailers, the air springs permit precise vehicle height adjustment for exact alignment, reducing trailer sway. Less roll and sway means a safer and more comfortable ride.",
      "Porpoising \u2013 Pickup trucks, even those that don't squat when loaded, can begin to \"porpoise\" vertically when towing heavy trailers. Progressive rate air springs dramatically reduce this problem for a safer, more comfortable ride.",
      "Suggested Accessories",
      "For maximum convenience and leveling on-the-go, nothing beats an Air Lift on board air compressor system. Automatic or dash-mounted, it quickly adjusts your vehicle for changes in load or road conditions. Air Lift compressor systems are the most advanced in the industry and work with all brands of air springs.",
      "Best Warranty in the Business",
      "Air Lift Company warrants that the RideControl air spring system will be free from defects in workmanship or materials for the lifetime of the vehicle of original installation. This does not include installation or other service charges for replacement.",
      "Exclusive 60 Day Ride Satisfaction Guarantee",
      "Air Lift guarantees you'll be happy with the improvement in road comfort and load handling. If you're not satisfied, you may remove the product and return it to your dealer for a full refund of your purchase price within the first 60 days after your purchase.",
      "Air Suspension Solutions that Fit, Work and Last",
      "Air Lift Company has been developing air spring suspension products for almost 60 years. The versatility of Air Lift air springs was proven during the early years of stock car racing. Air Lift products were used by most of the stock car racing teams for twenty years and the sponsored cars were among the toughest competitors on the NASCAR Grand National Circuit.",
      "Today, Air Lift has won more SEMA (Specialty Equipment Market Association) awards for air spring development products than any other company. Air Lift products are sold throughout the world and can be engineered to fit almost any coil or leaf spring suspension. The extensive product line includes everything from air helper springs for cars, vans and trucks to full air suspension replacement and control systems for recreational vehicles, emergency vehicles, hot rods and lowered performance vehicles.",
      "Quality and Performance \u2013 the Air Lift Difference",
      "As of February 2007, Air Lift Company is proud to be ISO 9001:2000 certified. ISO 9001:2000 applies to organizations which follow rigorous quality standards, and are committed to continuous improvement. Air Lift Company is dedicated to making suspension products that fit, work, and last."

Measure the circumference of the largest part of the child's head, (usually just above the eyebrows) in inches: Use a paper tape measure or a string and do not pull it too tight, loose like a hat would fit.",

      "The Guardian Bell Legend: The use of bells as a channel for positive energy dates back to antiquity. Across cultures, continents and religions, bells have been rung to banish evil spirits. It is considered good karma to have a bell on your door, which acts as a beacon for welcome news and prevents bad energy from entering. Many motorcycle riders and car enthusiasts attach bells to ward off mishaps and mechanical failures. You can grant this tradition of protection to anyone. Attach a Guardian Bell to a backpack, keychain, boat, locker or anyplace else. According to the legend, a Guardian Bell carries twice as much power when it is purchased by a friend or loved one and given as a gift. Show someone how much you care. Give a Guardian Bell and share the Legend of Good Luck it offers!"

      "Quality remanufactured fuel injectors that are electronically tested for correct electrical resistance and for coil weakness. Good units are then disassembled (micro filter, seals, pintle caps and plastic spacer are removed.) Injectors are simultaneously cleaned in ultrasonic tanks specially designed to clean fuel injectors. All units are individually back flushed to remove the broken dirt particles, these particles cannot be removed thru the injection orifices therefore are driven out thru the inlet of the injector. All injectors are then mounted on the flow bench in an inverted position to allow them to reverse flow at a considerable pressure. We run a high performance injector cleaning solvent thru the injectors for 30 minutes, completing the cleaning process. This process assures all dirt particles are completely removed from the injector. Injectors are now mounted on the flow bench in the correct position to begin the testing procedures. We apply 60 PIS of pressure (more than a regular multi-port fuel injection system) and maintain the injectors with no signal to them for 30 seconds to make sure there are no leaks. Depending on the original manufacturer presentation, the injectors are either painted or polished to give the best cosmetic appearance possible. Injectors are then assembled with new replaceable components (filter baskets, pintle caps, O-rings and seals) and a final test is performed with all new components on injectors. The purpose of this test is to make sure the filter basket; o-rings, seals and pintle caps are positioned correctly and are not disturbing the flow or the spray pattern of the injector. Injectors are lubricated with special oil and protective caps are placed on both ends to extend the shelf life and assure that when they are installed in the vehicle they will be in optimum operating condition. Each injector is individually bagged."

This lightweight helmet features a thermo-injected shell incorporating a special polymer blend enhanced by varying degrees of thickness that is engineered to deliver the optimal combination of impact protection and light weight, while the five density EPS liner ensures the correct density in the correct area for enhanced impact absorption. Other key design features include an engineered raised area with padding to effectively reduce the forces transmitted to the collarbone and a patented visor release system that ensures the visor is released with the correct pre-determined amount of force, irrespective of the angle of impact."
