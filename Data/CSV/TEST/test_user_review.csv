5,2013 Odyssey. Perfect fit. Near identical replacement.,"I found my light slightly damaged within the first week of purchasing...ouch!  I checked the dealer for pricing double ouch!  It wasn't leaking nor was it very obvious since the crack was on the clear indicator portion, so I thought I'd wait until I could afford something less expensive.  I discovered these and was extremely skeptical; especially about the color, since the OEM on-line images visibly seemed a much deeper red.  Nonetheless I finally decided to give this item a try for my 2013 Oddy...2 quick screws and the old lens were removed.  The item arrived nicely packaged, and included 2 new bulbs, I disconnected the wire connections with a slight squeeze, snapped them into the new lens, pushed slightly into place, attached the 2 screws and that was it.  I then checked brake and park lights...the whole thing took 3 minutes.  There was no discernable color difference.  Happy at the price, shipping, packaging, and most importantly the match to the vehicle.  Loved the fact that there was a little note on the screen before ordering that it will &#34;fit my 2013 Odyssey.&#34;",[],B008ESJX58,B01960CIB8,AHITBJSS7KYUBVZPX7M2WJCOIVKQ,2015-07-28 02:14:17.000,1,True

5,Seriously impressed! Glass shine all the way around!,"2nd day update:<br />See last 2 pictures. It rained and blew a ton of dust the night after the full detail. (Of course) the first is the dirty, the last picture is after a quick rinse and dry. Although it didn't completely repell the rain it came off super ez. And shined up like it never happened with minimal effort. Crazy how good this works.<br />Used this for the first time today. Used as a wax to clean after doing an at home pressure wash with my foam cannon. Unfortunately I have very hard water at my house so it's nearly impossible to get it perfectly dry. There is almost always hard water spots.<br />I decided to try this as a finishing product and I could not believe how great it works. It's literally a mirror finish all the way around. Every surface plastic, chrome, rims and paint all shine very easily.<br />I used about a quarter of  a bottle to detail a 2021 silverado z71 from front to back including the inside of the door trim and every surface including the external glass. Pretty impressive.<br />TIPS:<br />I used a micro fiber detailing sponge as the wet rub and it worked well.<br />Make sure whatever you use for the wet wipes portion stays damp. If it gets too dry it is A LOT more work. Comes off really easier if you keep the cloth/sponge damp. Not dripping wet, just hand squeeze dry it and that's about perfect.<br />You will notice a build up in the dry cloth, I used 2 micro fiber clothes on the body and trim and a third for the rims.

It does come with some stick on hook/loop strips to get a 'better fit'... as I am still on the fence as to whether or not I like the look, I haven't used the hook/loop to attach it but I can see where it MIGHT be helpful if you like the look.

Normally I just set my purse and/or other items on the passenger seat.  But when I have a passenger, it's difficult to figure out how to put my purse somewhere - I have a very small purse, so this mesh net does hold small purse.  If you have a medium or large purse, I really don't think it will work for you.  The front of the mesh netting sort of folds down so you need to reach back and open it to put your small purse in.  A larger one would just overwhelm the very small pocket area - meaning, your purse will likely fall out toward the front of the keeper area.  I am just not sure I will keep it.  There are other small pockets in the back of the keeper that are NOT convenient to reach from the driver seat, but could be used by people seated in the backseat - which is very rare for me.

3,Leather soap Aircraft,"I have a 2006 Lexus GX... it's old... I've had it since it had 3 miles on it.  The leather seats are totally solid - no tears or wear spots, in excellent shape for their age...really good quality leather.  But they do have the classic indigo &#34;denim blue&#34; on the edges.  I AM NOT a professional leather cleaner.... I just a regular person, so my review reflects a normal, regular person's experience using this product. Note: I also purchased a small, soft bristled brush that Amazon &#34;suggested&#34; with this purchase, NOT the seller - apparently the seller suggests some other type of brush. Please see &#34;comments&#34; to see what they recommend.  The brush is necessary if you ANY type of stain really.  I have included a few pics so you can see results for yourself.  It did fairly readily remove the browner, regular dirt stains... BUT the indigo blue, not really.  The &#34;after&#34; pics are post 6 applications and a LOT of scrubbing.  It really &#34;matted&#34; the leather too.  Fortunately I purchased a leather conditioner to use after cleaning. I highly recommend the conditioner whatever cleaner you use.  It worked on the door handle area well... less blue there expect where your knee would touch... I used exactly as directed on the bottle... you should know that they are suggesting a TWO microfiber rags... one wet and rung out... one dry. You spray, scrub, wipe with the damp rag, then with the dry rag. Tedious.  I happened to have some brand new microfiber cloths and they were pretty large.  Good thing.  You'll need to keep folding and folding away until you &#34;no longer see any stain lift&#34;...  It was just a lot of work even with a brush!  And wasn't completely successful in removing the blue hue. More successful on the less dirty door handle and panel area as I said before.  To be honest, I think I could have done as well with a mild detergent and warm water.  But hey, this does come with a handy spray bottle.  Comes down to whether or not you want to mix your own mild detergent in your own spray bottle. (which worked the same - despite what others may say or think) .... or go with this.

5,Couldn't be better.  Exact color match to my couch.,"My dog scratched up the leather on my couch and I thought I was going to need to buy a new couch.  Instead I decided to buy this repair kit, which comes with 3 most common leather colors.  Also it comes with black and white so you can darken or lighten the colors.  As it turns out the chocolate color was an exact match to my couch, so no need to mix other colors to lighten or darken it or change the hue.  Has an easy to use applicator and the job was done in probably under 10 minutes, covering an area that was about 12 x 12 or so.  I couldn't be happier with the result.  Still quite a bit of coloring left in the tube if the dog does it again.  Highly recommended.  The included color mixing chart was confusing to me, but my daughter explained it and then it was obvious.  Highly recommended.",[],B08375KJKD,B08375KJKD,AFAIJYOUO3NAWLBDIKTQSC3DASWA,2022-09-19 00:09:08.736,0,True
5,Large enough and bright enough for a good emergency light,"I wanted to see if this worked well with partially discharged (weak) batteries and indeed it does.  Even not using fresh batteries, the light seemed nice and bright and should be noticed from some distance.  With the less than fresh batteries, it tells me this would continue to work until the batteries were quite low.  That's important if you car gets stranded, if using it in your car (which is probably the best use of this item).  It has a nice strong magnet on the bottom to easily adhere to the top of your car or any metal that magnets work on.  Batteries were so easy to change.  The bottom unscrews to reveal the battery compartment.  It appears to be reasonably well made; not made of cheap, thin plastic that will break soon.  Although it appears to be mostly plastic, it is good quality.  Well worth the price for your safety.  I can't find anything to criticize with this item.  It is simple, well made and it works!  Has on/off switch and 2 different strobe patterns.",[],B07GSDX955,B07GSDX955,AFAIJYOUO3NAWLBDIKTQSC3DASWA,2019-05-21 23:38:56.116,0,False
4,"Nice Covers, but only work for certain types of seats","These are very colorful and seem to be durable and well made.  They seem to fit the seats snugly.  At first I thought they weren't big enough, but they stretch, so they fit firmly and won't be loosening up.  The fact that they stretch also probably makes them compatible with slightly different sized seats.  I was disappointed that I could not use these with the seats in my car because my seats have an arm rest attached to the side of the back of the seat.  If arm rests are separate, these should work for you, but if the arm rest is part of the seat, there is no way to work around it.  Another problem is that if ever want to adjust your headrests, if you have adjustable ones as I do, the seat cover goes over the head rest and you can't get to the button to adjust it.  We never adjust our headrests and most people probably don't, so probably wouldn't be a big issue.  A final little issue is that the backs of my seats have a pocket in them for use of the passengers in the back.  The seat covers cover that pocket, so you can't get to it.  If you don't use the pockets in the back of your seats or don't have them, that won't be a problem.  Really nice seat covers, but will only work with a certain type of bucket seat.  Also there is a warning on the package that they contain material that is known in California to cause cancer, but that wouldn't be a concern to me, as I wouldn't be making any direct contact with the material and have no children or pets that would be riding on the seats.  If you often wear shorts or sleeveless shirts, you might not want your skin touching them repeatedly, because of the cancer warning.  If you don't, I wouldn't worry about it and I wouldn't hesitate to use these, if they would fit my seats.",[],B00MB0CYZG,B00MB0CYZG,AFAIJYOUO3NAWLBDIKTQSC3DASWA,2014-10-12 19:34:49.000,0,False
4,Quality Made Product that Should Last a Long Time,"When I first opened the box, I was surprised at how light this was and thought that it can't be very good quality being so lightweight.  When I got it opened up to put on the seat, I discovered that it is actually very good heavy quality material, almost like a canvas material and it doesn't look like it will wear out for a long time.  Be sure you have a bench seat to put this on.  My back seats are actually individual, but I have an extender that goes between them that makes them like a bench.  Unfortunately that makes them somewhat wider than a regular bench, so the cover doesn't totally reach.  It still works reasonably well.  If you have a normal sized bench, this should do the job nicely for you and it is a quality product.  There are slots in it for two seat belts and they are made in such a way as to cover the opening, so that it looks good.  I don't think you'll go wrong with this product.",[],B008VLVDII,B08V2GHF6V,AFAIJYOUO3NAWLBDIKTQSC3DASWA,2012-12-28 01:38:20.000,1,False

4,Nice looking flagpole,"All in all it seems like a good quality flag pole. We will see later how the flag itself holds up to the constant flapping while I’m riding.<br />A lot of people have complained how either the flag eventually slips right off the end, or the top part unscrews and they lose both it and the flag.<br />There are a couple of easy solutions if you take the time to actually think about it. As far as the flag, slipping off after you screw the top piece on, you could add some stitching to make it really snugged on the pole, so it will not slip off.<br />An easier way is to simply get a flat washer that’s approximately the same diameter as the threaded part and put it on there before screwing the top piece on. That way there is no way the flag could slip off.<br />Most people that have lost that top piece, obviously didn’t think to tighten it with pliers.<br />I gripped the top piece and the pole with two pair of pliers, using a piece of cloth so the teeth wouldn’t tear up the chrome, and snugged it down.<br />It’s definitely not coming off. If you want to make doubly sure you could always put a small, very small amount of Loctite on there, but I personally wouldn’t do that. If you ever have to change out the flag, it would be very difficult to undo it without damaging the chrome.<br /><br />The manufacturer of this flag pole would be smart if they simply put a flat surface on two sides of the top piece so you could use an open end wrench to tighten it down. They could also flare out the bottom of the top piece, so a flag would not be able to get past it.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61QPq-trm2L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61QPq-trm2L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61QPq-trm2L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71pYbmYZrhL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71pYbmYZrhL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71pYbmYZrhL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07H7FYD8P,B07H7DDQ1N,AE4L2LH55JNFCLHFXFC7YOEQSBIA,2022-11-03 21:59:45.212,0,True

3,"The price is good, but you get what you pay for!",It’s definitely a lighter weight than the other alternator.

Castrol Actevo has been around a long time and has been used in racing applications, even by Honda. You can’t beat the price, of 6 quarts for around $35. You can do three oil changes for $70 whereas with Golden Spectro or Honda’s blend, you would pay around $150, not counting the oil filter.

My van has 4 cup holders in the console - 2 in the front part and 2 in the back part for the middle seats to access. A sedan probably only has 2 cup holders in the front, so it's not an issue.

4,Heavy Duty,"My 19 year old daughter recently inherited grandma's car. The car was well maintained, but we were surprised that Grandma didn't have any jumper cables in the trunk. We wanted our daughter to be prepared, so I ordered this. When it arrived, I was caught off guard with how heavy it was. I wasn't expecting that at all. Then after handling, you can immediately tell the difference between these cables and others. They are truly heavy duty. The very day they arrived, my daughter went to her car to put new floor mats inside. The door wasn't opening with the key fob, so she had to insert the key into the lock. Then it was discovered that the car battery was dead. Lucky for me, this gave me the perfect opportunity to try these out. They worked as they should and as expected. The car is a 2012 Honda Civic. The reader indicated that it wasn't an issue with the alternator., which was good. Our daughter got to learn first hand how to jump start her car. When the car was up and running again, we discovered that she had left one of the overhead lights on, so of course, we had to point that out to her so she would be aware of that in the future. We were able to charge the battery overnight. All is good. The cables come with a storage bag, but it was nearly impossible to get them back in it. In fact, I don't think I did get them in properly. I guess I was thinking that I would do that later. The set included a flashlight and a pair of gloves, too. The flashlight doesn't come with batteries and it was cracked, so we'll probably just give her a different one. We compared the cables with the ones in my husband's car and they are significantly heavier, longer, and thicker. I would definitely recommend these!",[],B08536R22B,B0BW4929X8,AHV6QCNBJNSGLATP56JAWJ3C4G2A,2020-08-06 23:03:59.602,1,False

3,Well....,"My daughter has recently gotten her first car. I thought this would be great for her to have. Well......it's got a lot of stuff in it, but the items are pretty basic and some of them are poor quality. The kit comes in a storage bag. There are jumper cables, a safety vest, tire pressure gauge, safety triangle, ice scraper, screwdriver, tape, whistle and more. The safety vest is pretty light weight and cheap, but it works and will definitely draw attention to you if you were out changing a tire. The whistle is sturdy and decent. The safety triangle is a much better option than road flares, but it's wobbly. The rain poncho is cheap and probably only a one time use. The snow shovel is really more like an ice scraper. The tow hook is not very sturdy and it's questionable as to how strong it would be in use.

4,Worked Well on One of Our Cars,"My husband's license plate got all bent up in a car wash recently. I thought this would help prevent that from happening again. He drives a Honda Civic. We started to install it with the holes at the top, but that covered up the expiration date and county. My husband didn't want to get a ticket for that. So we put it up the other way with the holes at the bottom. That worked really well. The license plate is secured with screws at the top and the frame is secured at the bottom. It came with tops to cover the screws so it's all uniform looking. We planned to put the other frame on our son's car. His plate has been bent up, too. (We think our state has been using really cheap, thin metal for tags!) Unfortunately, we couldn't use it on his car. He drives a Toyota Prius. The car doesn't have screw holes at the bottom, only at the top of where the plate goes. We tried my Toyota Sienna next. Same problem. Only top holes in my car, as well.

5,Easy to Set Up!,"We recently had a trailer hitch installed on my Toyota Sienna mini van. We thought this cargo rack could come in handy, especially with our daughter moving to college this fall. From out of the box, it took my husband less than 20 minutes to assemble. He used a socket set instead of the tools provided, which he recommends to anyone getting this. Once it was put together, it didn't take long to set it up on the van's hitch. It does require a wrench for installing it on the hitch, so make sure you take one with you just in case. There's a sleeve inside the bar that attaches to the hitch. The first time we tried hooking it up, the sleeve had slipped out a little, so we could not get the bolt to screw in because the threads weren't lined up properly. Once we discovered that, we were more careful when sliding it on to the hitch so the sleeve wouldn't slide out and we were able to get it in correctly. The hitch we have is close to the ground. This angles up a little so it leaves adequate clearance. My husband drove it around the neighborhood a few times and didn't notice any rattling or other noises, and it seemed to drive smoothly. The rack is pretty sturdy and well made. It did get scratched up a little during assembly though. Overall, we're quite pleased with it and better yet, we don't think we'll need to rent a trailer to move our daughter into her dorm. I think between this and the space in the van, we'll be good.",[],B07MP29G1J,B07MP29G1J,AHV6QCNBJNSGLATP56JAWJ3C4G2A,2019-06-29 19:30:48.846,0,False

5,Good to Have - Just in Case,"This is one of those things you hope you'll never need to use, but you want to have one, just in case. I have a similar car safety hammer in my car. My teenage son started driving this year and my daughter will be driving in a few months. It makes me feel a little better knowing that they have a way out of the car in the event of an emergency. This comes with two safety hammers. These hammers are comparable to the one I have. In addition to the glass breaking nobs, there is also a seat belt cutter. My husband would not let me try either of those out on the car, but I did cut some fabric scraps with the cutter and I pounded some wood with the glass breaking nobs. We have three cars, so now we can have one of these in each vehicle. It is important to make sure that you keep these where you can reach them from the driver's seat. It won't do you any good if they are in the back under the seat and you cannot reach them.<br /><br />*I received this for free in exchange for my honest &amp; unbiased review.

4,Cute!,"This is definitely a cute coin purse/cell phone holder! It's well made and secure. There are no loose threads or large globs of glue visible. The monkey face is glued to the rest of the item and you can see a little bit of glue. The zipper works well and is sturdy. The zippered compartment will work for storing a lot of things, but I personally do not care for how it's lined. If you were keeping coins in it or other small items, it's difficult to get them out because the liner is not sewn all the way in and it comes out a little bit. Coins and small items could get temporarily lost in the corners of the liner. That's not a huge deal, but it is a little annoying. I would love it if it had a way to clip it on to your backpack or bag. Phones do fit it in, but they are not secured so you would to be careful. It would be great for keeping your phone in it while you're at practice where as soon as you're finished you would be taking your phone out again.

4,Light Weight & Easy to Use!,"This wet/dry vac is a decent alternative to large household vacuums. It's small & compact so it doesn't take up a lot of room. It's also very light weight & easy to use. My household vacuum is a pain to take out into the garage to use in my minivan. It's not as powerful as the vacs available at the car wash, but it's not that different from what my household vacuum does. The hose is a little tricky to get it to stay in place. The directions say to push it in as deep as you can and when you do that, it does stay in place pretty well. Speaking of directions, the instruction sheet was easy to follow & actually written well! That's not always the case with online purchases.

5,It Really is the BEST Tire Pressure Gauge!,"I recently had the opportunity to purchase this at a discount in exchange for an honest review. I wasn't in the market for a tire gauge, but since ours was several years old, I decided to try it out. Now that we have this one, our old one will be officially retired! The title of this item is &#34;Best Tire Pressure Gauge&#34; and I would have to agree. First of all, it's solid & heavy duty. My husband said it was very easy to use. He was especially impressed with the fact that the gauge holds its reading when you take it off of the tire. It's a feature that isn't on our other gauge & is really appreciated.  You can read it from a more comfortable position rather than trying to read it while it's hooked up to your tire. Then, to clear the reading, you just have to press a button. This is not a gauge that you can keep in your glove box. It's really too bulky. But it comes with a hanging holder so you can store it on the garage wall.

5,Heavy duty,"I got tired of those ""stick"" tire pressure gauges breaking and of wondering whether they're accurate or not.  For less than ten bucks this is good:<br /><br />PROS:  Heavy duty; either side of the connector works so can use at different angles; checked it against a friend's expensive air compressor gauge and it's accurate; bleeder valve lets out air down to PSI you want; round part is encased in rubber.<br /><br />CONS:  Turns a one-handed job (with the stick gauge) into a two-handed job; takes up more space in a glove compartment.<br /><br />Press the connector onto the tire and it pressurizes the gauge to the PSI.  Then the gauge holds the reading until you press the bleeder valve on the side.  I fill my tires to ~35 PSI on a 12-volt portable air compressor, then use this and bleed it down to 30.

5,"Perfect Fit, Easy to Manage","We purchased two sets of front floor liners, one for a Ford Escape and the other for a Jeep Patriot. The installation in the Jeep turned out to be much more satisfactory for the following reasons: (1) the liners are much more FLEXIBLE than the ones we received for the Escape; and (2) the Jeep uses a simple hook to hold the driver's side carpet in place. The design of the liner on the driver's side easily accommodates the hook. (See my companion review of the liners for a Ford Escape.)<br /><br />Because of the flexibility of the liners and the interior design of the Jeep, it appears that the liners will be easily removable should they contain liquid or debris. They will readily go ""straight up and out"" of the vehicle should the need arise.<br /><br />The installation of the liners in the Jeep turned out to be a much more satisfying experience than for the Escape. The liners for the Jeep give a much better measure of this product. You should be very happy, as we are, if you buy these liners for your Jeep Patriot!",[],B000VBEF0Y,B000VBCDC6,AF7J5A2ME55LSCRVQWXB3BKE7CHQ,2013-02-16 10:44:53.000,5,True
4,Keeps Your Vehicle Clean (Updated June 2013),"These liners cover the front carpet for both the driver and passenger sides. They are very sturdy and help to trap whatever would have wound up on your interior carpeting. They fit snugly. All very good so far.<br /><br />The Ford Escape has two grommets (plastic) that normally hold the carpet in place. To install the liners, you must remove the carpet, which is easy to do. This leaves the two grommets exposed. Now the liner does have grommet holes which are supposed to match up with and fit over the two grommets. This is where matters go slightly awry: the liners that I received for the Escape are VERY stiff, so it is not very easy to position the liner holes over the grommets -- esp. the grommet farther in. I was not able to get the grommets into the holes of the liner. The holes seem a tad small. It does not seem to matter, because the liner fits very snugly and does not seem to move around at all. Since there are no grommets on the passenger front carpeting, there is no issue on the passenger side.<br /><br />Because the liners I received are so stiff, I am not quite sure how easy it will be to lift the liners out and dispose of any liquid that might accumulate (e.g. snow, coffee spills, and the like). There is the possibility that in trying to remove these liners, the liquid could wind up all over the remaining layer of carpet. It does not seem that the liners will easily go ""straight up and out"" because of the inside dimensions of the Escape and the size of the liners.<br /><br />All in all I am glad we bought them, because they are better than the alternative --  messy carpets. The liners are well made and they look good in the vehicle. I just wish they were a bit more flexible for the reasons outlined above.<br /><br />Updated June 1:<br />It is quite warm now in my neck of the woods, and I notice that these mats have softened just enough to make them more manageable. I contacted the company and was told I could soften them with a hair dryer, but I decided to wait to see if warmer weather would do the trick.  I have washed my driver side mat twice now using just water. The mats are black and seem to retain a mud-color residue on them. I will try using a mild detergent next time. I bought black because the original mats in the vehicle are black, but I think the lighter color may have been the better choice.

The palms are fine, but the fingertips are way too long.<br /><br />Sizing apart, the quality of the gloves are no better than you'd expect from cheap gloves. Sadly due to the sizing issue, it's hard to find the right size in any quality so I try to make due with what I can get. The knuckles are hardened, but not with that hard rubberized material other high quality gloves have. The rest of the glove is rather thin but flexible. While it's nice to have that extra mobility, I wouldn't trust these in a high speed fall. These would fall apart. For driving around town, these should be more than enough. And with the touch phone fingertips, it can be pretty convenient when quickly checking something on your phone.<br /><br />These are the gloves I'm using now, and so far with light use, they have been holding up just fine.
